1.Counting Occurrences:Count the occurrences of each element in the input array nums using the Counter class from the collections module. The result is a dictionary where the keys represent elements in nums, and the values represent their respective counts.
2.Calculating Threshold:Calculate the threshold for considering an element as a majority element.
3.Filtering Majority Elements:Make a list called result that includes elements appearing more than the calculated threshold. Using a list comprehension, iterate through the counted elements, adding each element to the result list if its count exceeds the threshold.
4. Return Result:Return the list of majority elements as the final result.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(k)
